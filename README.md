<small><i>Streamlining social connections has been increasingly vital to maintaining the health of communities, particularly during these isolating times in the COVID-era. The challenges of remote learning emphasize the need for simplified and equitable access to all resources. Jetlink's real-time matchmaking platform has none of the service barriers and access limitations of the traditional face-to-face service model. Using their school email to login, users can post help requests or provide tutoring services for their peers once vetted and approved.
